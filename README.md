# Task 5: SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)

## Objective
Practice combining data from multiple tables using SQL JOINs.

## Tables Used
- Customers
- Orders

## What I Did
- Created `Customers` and `Orders` tables with a foreign key relationship.
- Inserted sample data, including mismatched and null cases.
- Used INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN (via UNION).

## Tools
- MySQL (DB Fiddle / MySQL Workbench)

## Join Types Practiced
- INNER JOIN: Matches only common records.
- LEFT JOIN: Includes all customers, with NULLs for unmatched orders.
- RIGHT JOIN: Includes all orders, with NULLs for unmatched customers.
- FULL OUTER JOIN: Combined result showing all customers and orders, matched or not.
